# Godot Main Menu

This repository contains a simple main menu project built in Godot.  
I use this project as a learning reference and reusable template for future game projects.

I prefer to break down features into smaller, focused projects before starting larger games. This helps me better understand how things work under the hood, and this repository reflects that approach.

## 🎯 Purpose

The main goals of this project are to:

- Familiarize myself with the Godot editor and workflow
- Practice basic scene and node setups
- Experiment with 2D game mechanics such as movement, collisions, and signals
- Understand and practice basic GDScript syntax and logic

---

## 🔧 Features

- Start button
- Options menu
- Exit button
- Minimal and clean UI layout

---

## 📌 Notes

- This project is not intended for production or release
- It is mainly for self-learning, experimentation, and reference
- Code and structure may evolve as I continue learning Godot
